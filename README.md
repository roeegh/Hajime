**Hajime** is an app that provides a self introduction for myself. It also changes the background color of the app when a user taps a button. It also has buttons that link to my Twitter and Github profiles.

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

A few of my favorite applications are:
- Sileo
- Snapchat
- App Store

Some of the features I like about these apps are:
- Sileo: I like how it works as a repo system manager and also shows the depictions of different tweaks.
- Snapchat: I like how it has a lot of filters and how it does a lot of image processing.
- App Store: I like the simple design and the animations present on the Today page.

## Notes

The hardest part of building my app was understanding how constraints worked and making sure the size of everything looked the way I wanted it to.
